# Fancy contributing?

So you're interesting in conributing? Awesome!! 😁🎉

## It all starts with an issue 👀

Before you start any work we recommend adding an issue so the changes can be discussed first. If everyones on the same page then lets go for it!! 🤝

## Package Scripts 🤺

| Script      | Description                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| build       | Builds the package into `/.build`                    |
| lint        | Lints all typescript                                 |
| npm-publish | Publishes to NPM (you won't be able to publish this) |
| test        | Run all tests                                        |

## Tests 🧪

Tests are non-negotiable (pretty much our only hard line). We advise you follow a test first approach when implementing your changes. We write tests that assert behaviours, it is as simple as that.

## Getting that sweet merge 🤤

When you're happy with your work open a Pull Request in GitHub. At that point the CI will run, nothing will be merged that fails CI. We'll review it with you and then once everyone is happy with it we'll merge away and release the package. 🎉
